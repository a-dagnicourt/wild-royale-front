## Getting started

## Scripts:

- Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  - `npm start`
- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  - `npm run build`
- **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
